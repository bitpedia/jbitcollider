JBITCOLLIDER: Java Bitcollider

v0.8 Preview Release July 14, 2006

This is a preview release for advanced users. (If you have not previously
installed Java and launched standalone Java applications from the command-
line -- and perhaps even if you have -- you may run into problems using 
this version. 

ADVANTAGES

    * Processes files larger than 2GB in size.
    * Offers the graphical interface, and drag-and-drop Bitcolliding,
      on non-Windows systems for the first time.
    * Improves reliability of submission via browser
    
LIMITATIONS

    * No installer.
    * No Windows 'shell' integration. (No right-click option for "Bitzi 
      Lookup".) 

REQUIREMENTS

You must already have Java 5 (also known as Java 1.5) installed. You can 
check if Java is installed by executing 'java -version' at a command line. 
(The applet at <http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml> may also 
help, though it only checks the Java support available to your  browser, 
and jBitcollider runs outside the browser.)

Java be obtained from http://java.com if necessary.

USAGE 

Expand the downloaded jBitcollider-0.8.zip file. In the resulting directory, 
execute the appropriate run script (run.bat or run.sh) for your system.

To analyze files, either drag them from your desktop and drop onto the 
jBitcollider window, or click the 'browse' button and use the file chooser. 
Results will be submitted to Bitzi via your default web browser.
